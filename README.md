# Floating(Sticky)TableHeaderJavascript
Make the table header floating(sticky) throughout the window.

Two folders present. 
One is with Bootstrap where Javascript is required to make the header sticky for the window. The scrollTop value should be adjusted for different screen sizes.
The other is without Bootstrap where the same thing is implemented using only CSS.

**When using Javascript for this purpose, you have to manually adjust the <th> value for every column in the .invisible header class.**
