# Floating(Sticky)TableHeaderJavascript
Make the table header floating(sticky) throughout the window.
Invisible and visible are the two classes which control the sticky header.
Adjust the scrolltop value according to the location of your table. When the scroll value is achived, the .visible header's display is set to none and the .invisible header is shown which makes it appear.

**When using Javascript for this purpose, you have to manually adjust the <th value for every column in the .invisible header.***
